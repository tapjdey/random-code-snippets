,,JDBC;Network Server,2019-12-30T11:48:37.000+0000,sagar,sagsaw,The derbyclient.jar file does not have the org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver.class When I add the jar file in squirrel; ssquirrel automatically detects the driver but since this class is missing it does not detect it. Till now I was using 10.11.1.1 database. Now I have decided to upgrade and this issue cropped up. Yes Derby has switched to the module system from 10.15.1.3 but the derby documentation mentions connection to Network Server similar to previous as using the org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver and this class is missing from the new derbyclient.jar.
